TODO

1. Support KeyValueFile (like SequenceFile formatted as serialized KeyValuePairs)
2. Add KeyValueWriter interface with ShuffleWriter and FileKVWriter implementations
3. Add more jobs: inverted index of movies by actor, time series using GroupComparator (lead function?)
4. Refactor input directories, add more detailed description of each job
